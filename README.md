# OpenEmuRPC

A simple application that provides your current OpenEmu game as an RPC state in Discord via [PyPresence](https://github.com/qwertyquerty/pypresence). Only available for MacOS, as is [OpenEmu](https://openemu.org/).

## How to use
Unzip and open the latest x86_64 version from the [releases tab](https://github.com/MCMi460/OpenEmuRPC/releases)
## How to build
Download the repository and run [build.sh](scripts/build.sh).

### If the app displays a Launch Error, give it permission like so:

**ï£¿ -> System Preferences -> Security and Privacy -> Screen Recording -> +**  
...and choose the app's location.
